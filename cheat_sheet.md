# HEADER 1 - basic paragraphs

***

To create paragraphs use blank line to separate paragraphs.
Realy cool feature to separate sentences on lines of text or to fit text to defined width.
Above this paragrapph ruler is used, it maked with:

- "\*\*\*" 3 or more asterics;
- "\-\-\-" 3 or more hyphens;
- "\_\_\_" 3 or more undescores.

To create line breaks simply put 2 or more spaces  
with return, eventually.

So in line above line break is formed.

## HEADER 2 - use of quotation

> This is the first level of quoting, maked by "\>" character at the begining of each line.
>
> This is the secondd line of block quotes.
>>
>> This is nested blockquote (2\`nd level), and, by the way, it\`s second paragraph.

### HEADER 3 - lists

For plain list "\-", "\+", "\*" symbols must preceed text.

Plain list:

- Try;
   - To;
       - Stick;
   - With;
   - Your;
- Favourite;
- List indicator.

Ordered list:

1. Ordered;
    1. List;
    	1. With nested;
2. Items;
3. Inside.

#### HEADER 4

Make
*italics, aka emphasis*
just that easy by using "\_" or "\*".

And
**strong emphasis, aka bold**
can be made just by adding another "\_" or "\*" from both sides.

To make both
***italics and bold***
simply put another "\_" or "\*" from both sides.

Best practice is to use "\*" for amphasis, this makes it more readable and compiling friendly.

There some
~~strike over~~
characters here, maked by double "\~" around required text.

##### HEADER 5 - code blocks

    Put 4 spaces or 1 tab and get code block.

By the way, single "\`" symbol used for `single` or `few words` code block.
